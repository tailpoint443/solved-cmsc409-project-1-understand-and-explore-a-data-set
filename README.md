<h2>A) Understand and explore a data set</h2>

Three data sets (set A, B, and C) have been created following normally distributed classes. These data sets provide examples of male and female population where:

<ul>

 <li>The first column represents the height in feet.</li>

 <li>The second column represents the weight in pounds.</li>

 <li>The third (last) column corresponds to the gender (0 for male, and 1 for female).</li>

</ul>

Each data set contains 2,000 samples for each gender.

For each data set, do the following:

<ol>

 <li>Plot the data for male and female students.</li>

 <li>Manually draw (by hand) a separation line. This will be a linear separator (or decision function) which separates female and male students.</li>

 <li>Determine the equation of this linear separator

  <ol>

   <li>Write the definition of a neuron. Note: Think of the inequality we covered in class.</li>

   <li>Determine the weights and threshold. Comment.</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>Calculate false positives and false negatives (refer to confusion matrix).</li>

 <li>Calculate accuracy, error, true positive rate and true negative rate, false positive rate and false negative rate.</li>

 <li>Compare results for each data set and explain the differences. How are these datasets different?</li>

</ol>

Important: Assume the example of true positive: the class is “it is a female” and prediction is “female”

<h2>B)McCulloch-Pitts neurons</h2>

<ol>

 <li>Create a truth table for the artificial neuron below. What is the functionality of this neuron?</li>

 <li>Given the same set of weights and the determined functionality of a neuron, what would be the range of possible values for threshold?</li>

</ol>
